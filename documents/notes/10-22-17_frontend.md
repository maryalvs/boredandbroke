## Notes from frontend meeting on 10/22  
  
  
-We have base pages for Homepage, index, Login/CreateAccount, SavedActivities, Settings, and SingleActivityModal  
-All of the pages have been merged from Mackenzie's branch into the "front-end" page  
-Megan will make a slider component (as it's own file) to be used for the radius and price range. She will also make the zip code an editable input field.  
-Josh will make the nav bar, which includes the logo and the user's name with dropdown. That is used on every page except login/createAccount.  
-Jordan will do the LoginCreateAccount page. Use the instagram website for example. We are contemplating making a modal specifically for "create an account".  
-Saved activities is fine for now  
-Josh or Megan will take a look into the settings page once they finish their other pages. Settings page has a default price, location, and radius. Will also contain a name (provided by user), and email-which will come from Facebook and the user will not be able to edit. Also will have a bio from the user.  
-Single Activity Modal with the event description, information, tagline, and carousel will be done by Mackenzie.
