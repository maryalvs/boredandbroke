### What we did this week
The backend team wrote most of the necessary database queries this week using Sequelize.js.
They also attempted to call the API's using React, and failed to do so thus far.        
The frontend team is workingon the responsive aspects of the website. They also created links to the other pages.

### What we're going to do next week
The backend team is going to continue trying to get the API's working with React.
They are also going to write tests for the queries using a mock sequelize database.

The frontend team is going to create the navbar next week to allow access to the other
pages from the homepage.

### Blockers
API calling is being difficult with React.
The Facebook API is still not redirecting to the homepage after login.

### Questions
We most likely need help with the blockers. 

### Punch List
Call the API function once every 24 hours.                       
Parse Activity objects from Activity database queries.            
Parse User objects from User database queries.                
Finish the deduplicator module.             
Write tests for the database, deduplicator, and activityRetriever.              
Connect frontend to backend.            
Finish the paths between pages.  
Implement the React router in the nav bar (it's currently at the top of the page).  
Always direct to Login page first.  
Finish the new nav bar.
