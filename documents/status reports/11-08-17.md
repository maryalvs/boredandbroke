### What we did this week
This week, the database team created model defintions using Sequelize for our database. 
This allows us to define and create Postgres tables. We also wrote out stub functions that outline the rest of the work
that needs to be done for the functionality of our product to be complete. 

The team also worked on integrating Facebook login with our application, although we ran into problems (enumerated below).

The frontend team added access points to and from the various webpages to connect them all together. They are also working on creating the user settings form that allows a user to change their settings.

### What we're going to do next week
Next week, the backend/database team will begin to implement the stub functions by using Sequelize's version of SQL queries to interact
with our database. We will also be finishing a de-duplicating module to prevent having duplicate activities in our database.

The front end team is going to work on the dropdown menu that is on the homepage.

### Blockers
The Facebook API is giving us trouble because our website is not a https website (or atleast we think that is why we can't get login to work yet).

### Questions
Does anyone have experience with the Facebook API?
