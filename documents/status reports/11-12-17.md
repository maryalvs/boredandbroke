### What we did this week
The frontend team set up linking so that the other pages can be accessed from the app.
They also implemented the logic for the event description modal. When you click on an event,
the modal now pops up.  

The backend team implemented "getUserInfo" from the database, and continued working on the
de-duplicating module.

### What we're going to do next week
Next week, the backend team is going to implement "getActivity", "getFutureActivities", "addUser", and "deleteUser".
The frontend team is going to continue working on linking the pages in the dropdown and will start displaying the activity information.

### Blockers
We are having some trouble merging the frontend branch to the backend branch. We are
trying to merge but are getting package.JSON as well as compilation errors.
The Facebook API login isn't redirecting after a successful login, which needs to
happen to bring the user to the homepage from the login page.
