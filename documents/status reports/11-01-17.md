### What we did this week
- Database running on server
- Software Design Description Document
- Preliminary Design Review Presentation
- Discussed general look of the app (login page, etc)

### What we're going to do next week
Next week we will be finalizing account capabilities. We will be able to store the Facebook user IDs in the database along with the rest of the user's information. The frontend team will continue to make improvements to the UI.

### Blockers
Setting up the database with AWS caused some challenges. Our access was restricted to a specific IP address so we had to figure out how to take away this restriction so that we could connect locally. Dondi helped us with this so this is no longer an issue. 

### Questions
No questions as of now.
